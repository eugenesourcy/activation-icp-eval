[13:46, 02/02/2026] +92 313 2054736: Importing in Pakistan no problem
[13:47, 02/02/2026] Sourcy: Yes, want to be very transparent as we had zero experience in importing batteries. We worry that it might affect the sourcing performance, and we don`t want you, as our customer experience that kind of situation. Thank you for your understanding
