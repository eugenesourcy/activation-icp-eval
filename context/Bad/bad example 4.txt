[10:00, 02/02/2026] Sourcy: Hi there,

This is Michael from Sourcy. We received your information when you expressed interest in sourcing some items with us under anthony company name.

Could you please share more details about the item you are looking for? Any pictures, videos, or product links would be very helpful!

P.S. We have a 100$ voucher for your sampling process
[10:01, 02/02/2026] +60 11-3741 1165: I'm looking for airpods or electronics in particular
[10:02, 02/02/2026] Sourcy: Thank you, Anthony, for your response. To be transparent, we are unable to source specific brand products; however, we can help you find something similar without the brand.

Would that be acceptable?

Additionally, may I ask for your company's website or social media links? We need them for our system submission. :)
[10:05, 02/02/2026] +60 11-3741 1165: I'm actually a individual reseller
[10:08, 02/02/2026] Sourcy: Ah I see, no worries, may I know if you have target qty and target price for those electronics?
[10:09, 02/02/2026] +60 11-3741 1165: im planning to buy like 50 then sell for like rm5-10profit
[10:42, 02/02/2026] Sourcy: Thank you for sharing this with us, Anthony. I apologize, but at this time, our company is primarily focused on collaborating with brands and companies. We are still working on developing our services for resellers like you. One of the main reasons for this shift is the increase in shipping costs when processing low-quantity orders for individual projects.

Once again, thank you for your interest in Sourcy, and I hope our paths cross again in the future.
[10:47, 02/02/2026] +60 11-3741 1165: Okay thanks
