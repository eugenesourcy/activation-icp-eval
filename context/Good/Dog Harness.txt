[1/19/26, 11:45:40 AM] kikemarchan: Yeah thanks, quality is very good as expected 😀
[1/19/26, 11:45:55 AM] kikemarchan: We just have some doubts with sizing and dog breeds
[1/19/26, 11:46:11 AM] kikemarchan: We will need to check with different dogs to be sure 🐶
[1/19/26, 11:50:30 AM] Ash: Glad to hear, then the next steps is to confirm the size of the harness
[1/19/26, 11:50:41 AM] Ash: Will wait for further feedback

[1/20/26, 2:21:42 PM] kikemarchan: Two additional questions:

Can the silver metal parts be coated in a gold tone for the first set (earth colors)?

Where can the logo be placed? We are interested in having it on the collar, leash, and harness if possible.
[1/20/26, 2:32:49 PM] Ash: Thank you Enrique for sharing this, let me share this with the supplier and feedback to you within this week
[1/20/26, 2:33:20 PM] kikemarchan: Thanks Ash!
[1/20/26, 5:22:41 PM] kikemarchan: can u also ask the supplier if a hangtag can be included? 😄 hangtag and rubber patch logo
[1/21/26, 10:21:26 AM] Ash: Hi Enrique, i have added this question, and waiting for the supplier's feedback
[1/21/26, 10:23:07 AM] kikemarchan: thanks Ash!
[1/21/26, 10:24:35 AM] Ash: Do you already have the design for the logo?
[1/21/26, 10:59:40 AM] Alessandro: unfortunately not yet, finalizing it. We’ll share as soon as possible
[1/26/26, 2:26:28 PM] Ash: Hi @⁨Alessandro⁩ and @⁨kikemarchan⁩ I am preparing the requotation based on the colors sent for the leash, collar and harness. The set with 3 items can be done for 400 units and spread across different sizes.

However, for the waste bag, since it will require a mold for mult-color, an MOQ of 1000 units is required
[1/26/26, 2:27:04 PM] kikemarchan: waste bag we can do uni-color then
[1/26/26, 2:27:12 PM] Ash: The supplier confirm

[1/26/26, 2:27:13 PM] kikemarchan: and do multi-color in the future
[1/26/26, 2:27:36 PM] Ash: For the logo, it can be hangtag and rubber patch
[1/26/26, 2:28:00 PM] Ash: and the silver color of the accessories can be transformed into gold.

[1/26/26, 2:30:50 PM] kikemarchan: Like this. I made a small change in the collar loop and added the uni color format for the bag holder
[1/26/26, 2:35:56 PM] kikemarchan: Golden accessories for the Set 1, Silver for Set 2
[1/26/26, 3:34:52 PM] Alessandro: Hi @⁨Ash⁩ thanks for sending updated info. For the logo we haven't yet finalized, is it ok to use a mock logo for quotation purposes?
[1/27/26, 12:27:05 PM] Ash: Good day @⁨Alessandro⁩ yes, if you have the mock logo, then I’ll just inform the supplier that the logo can change later.
Does you logo have multiple colors?
[1/27/26, 5:39:07 PM] kikemarchan: We will use just one color
[1/27/26, 5:39:43 PM] kikemarchan: We tried the harness in different dogs. It's weird but the M size is slightly big for medium dogs around 10-12 kilos, while the S is too small for them.

[1/27/26, 5:41:17 PM] kikemarchan: I guess they use international standards but this happened to us in two dogs 😂😅
[1/28/26, 11:04:22 AM] Ash: This is noted. Also, good news, the supplier accepted 400 units for the waste bag holder. Will be sending the quote today
[1/28/26, 11:21:32 AM] Ash: Do we need to make any adjustment on the size?
[1/28/26, 2:55:46 PM] kikemarchan: I think we will keep the supplier sizing, but we definitely will need XS-S-M-L
[1/28/26, 2:56:09 PM] kikemarchan: Small dogs around 3-4kgs, that are very common here in PH, are too small for the S they provided
[1/28/26, 2:56:34 PM] kikemarchan: Anyway we checked other merchants and brands. Sizing is quite similar across every brand
[1/28/26, 2:57:18 PM] kikemarchan: So something like 100-125-125-50 for the quantities
[1/28/26, 2:58:41 PM] kikemarchan: For the leash we believe that only two sizes are okay. S-M
[1/28/26, 3:01:13 PM] Ash: This is noted. Let me finalize the quote and share it with you
[1/28/26, 4:51:42 PM] Ash: @⁨Alessandro⁩ @⁨kikemarchan⁩
For the Leash and Collar, the samples provided to you were in 3 sizes S,M,L 
For the collar, may I know if these sizes are okay? Or you need XS for this? ‎<This message was edited>
[1/28/26, 4:59:07 PM] kikemarchan: XS also! S was too big for small dogs
[1/28/26, 5:45:33 PM] Ash: This is noted. Thanks!

Please note that for the leash there's only S,M,L
[1/29/26, 7:29:27 PM] kikemarchan: Hey Ash! Thanks for the quotation

[1/29/26, 7:31:53 PM] kikemarchan: Third comment is: we would like to request some samples with the final pattern and colors, with logo printed. We don't wanna invest 720k php to receive something that maybe is not what we want/final quality is not accurate
[1/29/26, 7:55:59 PM] Ash: Understood Enrique, thanks for the feedback
[1/30/26, 1:08:27 PM] Ash: Do you also have a preferred packaging for the set?
[1/30/26, 1:09:19 PM] kikemarchan: what are the options
[1/30/26, 1:13:32 PM] Ash: The standard packaging is the same OPP bags that were sent for sample
[1/30/26, 1:15:21 PM] Ash: There is a color card packaging, I will share here once I received the picture from the supplier

[1/30/26, 1:47:32 PM] Alessandro: Instead of this, is it possible to have a paper tag attached to each product?
‎[1/30/26, 1:47:38 PM] Alessandro: ‎<attached: 00000100-PHOTO-2026-01-30-13-47-38.jpg>
[1/30/26, 1:47:44 PM] kikemarchan: it's in the quotation
[1/30/26, 1:47:49 PM] Alessandro: And then the OPP bag
[1/30/26, 1:47:50 PM] kikemarchan: they already included it
[1/30/26, 1:48:18 PM] Alessandro: Ok so no need for this
[1/30/26, 1:48:34 PM] Ash: So it will be a hang tag and the OPP
[1/30/26, 1:48:48 PM] Ash: I am waiting for the supplier's confirmation ‎<This message was edited>
[1/30/26, 1:49:00 PM] kikemarchan: yeah, we like that but I believe it's more for retail than from e-comm
[1/30/26, 1:49:01 PM] kikemarchan: maybe in the future
[1/30/26, 2:38:50 PM] Ash: This is noted. For the protype sample, we can do the samples with the actual color combination per set. This will include the harness, collar and leash.

However, for the waste bag, the supplier is not able to produce sample. What they can do is send the set with the color you desire and if the color is approved, the same dye will be used for the waste bag.

The waste bag, can only be produced once you have approved the actual color sample in person. Then only the waste bag will be produced in bulk
[1/30/26, 2:39:18 PM] kikemarchan: okay
[1/30/26, 2:39:20 PM] kikemarchan: understood
[1/30/26, 2:44:43 PM] Ash: I’ll send two quotation. One for the sample and the other is for bulk. Please allow me some time to finalize this today.
Appreciate your patience
[1/30/26, 2:45:03 PM] kikemarchan: yes! no worries Ash thanks for ur help
[1/30/26, 2:46:23 PM] Ash: Thanks, it’s a pleasure and glad to be working on this new product development with you and Alessandro.
[1/30/26, 5:14:03 PM] Ash: Regarding the sample of the final pattern and color with logo printed, do you need these in different sizes as well?
Or it’s okay just to have the 2 sets

Set 1: Small Autumn (Burgundy/Tan)
Set 2: Medium (Sage (Green/Cream)
[1/30/26, 5:14:32 PM] kikemarchan: it's ok to have 2 sizes, we just want to feel the color and textures
[1/30/26, 6:51:24 PM] kikemarchan: @⁨Ash⁩ can u ask if they have an XS leash instead of the S? And what are the specs
[2/2/26, 9:31:26 AM] Ash: Hi @⁨kikemarchan⁩ will share with you the price and spec for the leash today
[2/2/26, 9:32:43 AM] kikemarchan: salamat!

[2/2/26, 3:20:44 PM] Ash: For the leash, there is an XS, the dimension is 12.5mm x 1.7mm, with a length of 1.5 meters.
While the Small is 19mm × 3.5mm, with a length of 1.5 m ‎<This message was edited>
[2/2/26, 3:20:58 PM] Ash: would you like to have the XS instead of Small?

[2/4/26, 1:53:52 PM] Alessandro: Hi @⁨Ash⁩, regarding the dyeing fee, if we reorder the same colors would we have to pay again?
[2/4/26, 1:54:43 PM] Ash: Good question, I will ask this. 

Let me confirm the pricing as well for Enrique
[2/6/26, 2:14:29 PM] Ash: Hi @⁨Alessandro⁩ please note that for re-orders, the dyeing fee will only be free if the MOQ is met.
It will be a minimum of 300 pcs. per style, per size. So let's say Set 1 with 3 different sizes, it will be a total of 900 qty. The dyeing fee will be for free.
[2/6/26, 3:26:52 PM] Alessandro: Hi @⁨Ash⁩ thanks for clarifying it
