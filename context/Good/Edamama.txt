[6/3/25, 4:30:06 PM] Ash: Hi Cj, certainly. Here it is.

[6/3/25, 4:38:16 PM] Ash: What do you think about these designs?
[6/3/25, 4:40:00 PM] Ash: For  play gyms item 11,12, & 13 the package is a colored box like this.
[6/3/25, 5:24:59 PM] Ash: This price is DDP including shipping cosrs. Duties and import taxes
[6/3/25, 5:28:03 PM] Ash: Hi Cj, upon checking we need to order 300 pieces at once if you decide to get the brown plain box. Because they would need to make it.

The factory model is the colored box.
[6/3/25, 5:28:44 PM] Ash: The brown box is available only for this item. Cos this is from a different supplier which can accommodate your quantity
[6/3/25, 5:56:53 PM] Ash: Hmmm, as an alternative, would you consider having only the play gym without a box, so we can look for another supplier for a box that can be customized
[6/3/25, 5:59:01 PM] ~ Cj: Yes, we are open as wellnin getting just the gym and separate box. Box can be just plain, then we can put sticker on it as well
[6/3/25, 6:00:45 PM] Ash: For the sticker, we suggest to place it here when the product arrives, so you can also easily check the quality of the items
[6/4/25, 1:02:51 PM] Ash: Hi everyone! Just checking in, have you had a chance to shortlist your approved designs from the quotation?

Stocks are limited, so it’d be great to know your preferred options while they’re still available. 🌻
[6/4/25, 1:14:24 PM] Ash: For the rolled up mat, this is the packaging XPE+individual box. Should we request for another carton size, it needs to be custom made and it will be a minimum of 100 pcs.of carton. 
- for the custom-made carton box, 4 XPE rolled up mat can be stacked together.
- ⁠the remaining custom-made carton box can be delivered, for future use.

Please let me know if you want to the factory’s standard packaging as show below. Or you want the PE packaging with the custom-carton box
‎[6/4/25, 1:14:34 PM] Ash: Screenshot 2025-06-04 at 1.05.05 PM.png ‎document omitted
[6/4/25, 1:43:42 PM] ~ Cj: Hi Ash, since custom size for the playmat carton is 100 pcs, and 4 mats per carton, we will only use up 30 cartons if we order 120 mats? Can you provide a quotation if we go with the PE + individual box, and PE + 4 in custom box, so we can see the comparison
[6/4/25, 1:46:44 PM] ~ Cj: For play gyms, would it be possible to ask for actual samples for item no. 10 and 12?
[6/4/25, 2:07:57 PM] Ash: Can, i'll work on the quotation for the play mats. 

Are you able to shortlist the design you want so then when we send you the quote we can include only the shortlisted items?
[6/4/25, 2:10:03 PM] Ash: I'll follow up on this request
[6/4/25, 2:11:47 PM] ~ Cj: Thank you!
[6/4/25, 3:45:55 PM] Ash: Hi Cj, we can arrange for the sample of the item. You can enjoy a 100USD voucher for the sample.
[6/4/25, 4:02:26 PM] ~ Cj: is this in total or per sample?
[6/4/25, 4:09:35 PM] ~ Cj: Also, can we do this for both play gyms?
[6/4/25, 4:58:35 PM] Ash: So the XPE rolled mat and play gym will be on a plain carton box right?
[6/4/25, 4:59:07 PM] Ash: Yes, this is the total per sample
[6/4/25, 5:02:10 PM] ~ Cj: Sorry, total per sample, meaning 100 USD for mats and 100 USD for play gyms?
[6/4/25, 5:03:36 PM] Ash: 100USD for the total samples ( including play gym and mats)
[6/4/25, 5:14:17 PM] ~ Cj: Ahhh gets okay
[6/5/25, 9:12:39 AM] ~ Cj: Hi @⁨Ash⁩ , good morning! As discussed yesterday, please provide quotation for the play gym samples item no. 10 and 12. Also, if we can get a clearer photo of the play mats no.  14, 15, 18,19. Thank you!

[6/5/25, 11:39:48 AM] Ash: Yes, item 25 - 28 are the XPE rolled up play mat from another supplier. The price is 538.68
[6/5/25, 11:42:06 AM] Ash: For item 14 -20, these are XPE foldable play mat from a different supplier with a PE bag packaging. I will send you a clearer picture for item 14, 15, 18 & 19 shortly
[6/5/25, 11:42:51 AM] ~ Cj: Thanks Ash!
[6/5/25, 11:43:46 AM] Ash: Yes, the difference is just the color. The MOQ 60 pieces. I need to rectify this.
[6/5/25, 11:44:01 AM] ~ Cj: So 14-20 mats is cheaper in terms of landed cost?
[6/5/25, 11:44:42 AM] Ash: Yes, the foldable play mat is cheaper than the rolled up mats

To proceed, may I kindly ask you to shortlist your preferred designs? This will allow us to check and confirm availability directly with the suppliers.

Please note that our initial request is 60 pcs per design (3 designs), totaling 180 pcs for play gyms and 180 pcs for play mats across 3 designs.

Pending action from my end: 
- To send you the sampling quotation
- ⁠To send updated quotation with the custom-made boxes for play gym and play mats. 

Looking forward to your selection.
[6/5/25, 12:34:53 PM] ~ Cj: For the rolled mats, can they ship it out na flat?
[6/5/25, 1:47:06 PM] Ash: Hi Cj, this will be more expensive and if laid out flat. The supplier can only deliver it rolled up in PE or carton box.
[6/5/25, 2:17:37 PM] ~ Cj: With the rolled up XPE mats kasi, parang half na ng cogs price yung logistics cost. is there any way we can reduce this?
[6/5/25, 2:38:28 PM] Ash: Yes, hence, we need to shortlist the designs that you prefer so we can see the actual volume and cbm of the items.
[6/5/25, 4:36:06 PM] Ash: Hi @⁨~Cj⁩ are there any more items you would like to sample?
Kindly note that the supplier for item 10 agreed to send a sample.

[6/5/25, 5:09:33 PM] ~ Cj: For the rolled mats, landed cost is not workable for us.  Pricing should be around of the folded one

[6/22/25, 1:23:37 PM] Ash: Hi @⁨~Cj⁩ may I ask if both samples are okay? Or you only prefer the play gym with the wooden rack + wooden toys?
[6/23/25, 9:18:44 AM] ~ Cj: Hi @⁨Ash⁩ , for the wooden play gym, were you able to check if there's a different print for the round mat? Also, feedback on the hanging toys for the wooden one, preferred if we can have a hook type instead of a yarn/string
[6/23/25, 9:26:26 AM] Ash: Hi Cj, im still sourcing for another print of the mat with the string for the rack
[6/23/25, 9:28:57 AM] Ash: What about the other sample for the play gym?  Pasado sya sa preference ni Bea?
[6/23/25, 10:36:56 AM] ~ Cj: The other one is okay, concern will be the packaging
[6/23/25, 10:55:31 AM] Ash: Because of the colored box, right?
[6/23/25, 10:56:29 AM] ~ Cj: Yes, have we asked if we can provide the box?
[6/23/25, 12:19:23 PM] Ash: Yes, still waiting for feedback from the supplier of XPE rolled mat if we can send out the box to their factory for packing
[6/23/25, 12:22:27 PM] Ash: Just to clarify, this box is for the XPE rolled mat right? 

For the other play gym na may sensory toys, plain box din ba yung prefer nila similar to the play gym na wood?
[6/24/25, 2:12:48 PM] ~ Cj: Yes, plain box across all products
[6/24/25, 4:01:08 PM] Ash: Got it CJ, thank you for clarifying

[6/24/25, 5:57:46 PM] Ash: Is it okay if I send the updated quote with the other variant for toys and mat until Friday?
[6/27/25, 8:55:46 AM] ~ Cj: Hi @⁨Ash⁩ , please send the updated quote once ready. Thanks! Also, do you have a feedback if about the consolidation?
[6/27/25, 7:12:52 PM] Ash: Hi @⁨~Cj⁩ upon checking, for the rolled up mats, should we order the boxes separately and have it sent to the factory for packing, they have a service fee that is 55 USD.

1. For the customized box for the rolled mats, since we have specific dimension (4 XPE in one box) need minimum 300 pieces for kraft box. I'll confirm the price from the factory
2. ⁠For the play mat, within the budget there are other designs available but suppliers doesn't have it in stock, hence minimum of 500 pcs. 
3. ⁠Consolidation of your sourced items to our warehouse, we can do this but we can only send the bill once the items are complete. Cos only then we can determine the price.
4. ⁠For the play gym with colored boxes. The supplier can change the packaging to a plain kraft box.

[7/1/25, 10:17:39 AM] ~ Cj: Do we have other colors din for this?
[7/1/25, 10:28:11 AM] ~ Cj: For the play gyms - will move forward with the soft ones nalang since it will be safer for babies and pricy if we do the mixing for the wooden one. If we have other colors din for the gym with the elephant toys. Is it correct that they will do the plain kraft box? If yes, is it the same size as the one you send us here?

For consolidation - even estimate cost? We need to understand how you will compute the cost, is it warehousing+ per cbm, or all in per cbm rate.

For XPE Playmats - can you send clearer photos for the design?
[7/1/25, 1:28:37 PM] Ash: for the play gym, yes plain kraft box na siya, there are no more other colors available. 

For the consolidation services, please me check the estimated cost.

[1/21/26, 1:58:55 PM] Ash: The supplier is nudging as the time is very tight for the production
‎[1/21/26, 2:21:01 PM] ~ Cj: PEBBLES bean play gym packaging.pdf • ‎1 page ‎<attached: 00000145-PEBBLES bean play gym packaging.pdf>

[1/21/26, 2:21:59 PM] Ash: sending this right away to the supplier
[1/21/26, 2:26:28 PM] Ash: May I ask what was the material used for the label insert?
[1/21/26, 2:27:25 PM] Ash: What is the size of the label insert?
[1/21/26, 2:29:21 PM] Ash: the standard material of the supplier is 250gsm white cardboard.
[1/21/26, 2:29:39 PM] Ash: And printing used CMYK
‎[1/21/26, 2:40:30 PM] ~ Cj: ‎<attached: 00000152-PHOTO-2026-01-21-14-40-31.jpg>
[1/21/26, 3:21:31 PM] Ash: Also the supplier updated us regarding the packaging
[1/21/26, 3:23:03 PM] Ash: currently they only have the square pointed edges, unlike the previous bags the edges were curved

[1/21/26, 3:26:00 PM] Bea (Edamama) V: Is there a change in dimensions?
[1/21/26, 3:26:07 PM] Ash: the same size

[1/21/26, 3:26:29 PM] Ash: Thanks Bea, will confirm with the supplier
[1/21/26, 3:27:59 PM] Ash: @cj is this in 11 x 16 in inches?
[1/21/26, 8:14:05 PM] ~ Cj: Yes, its in inches
[1/21/26, 8:16:14 PM] ~ Cj: may fold siya sa middle. Use this photo as referrence
[1/23/26, 3:05:24 PM] Ash: Hi @⁨~Cj⁩ please be informed that the production for the gray play gym has been completed, but the label insert is not done yet. Once this is done, the factory will proceed with the packaging.
[1/23/26, 3:08:52 PM] Ash: For the beige color, during the QC, there were defective items that needed to be replaced. Therefore, at the moment the total quantity is short by 42 pcs. The factory would need to purchase more fabrics to replace the defect items. But since the Chinese Holiday is fast approaching, the time is very tight and may cause the timeline to be further extended for the Beige color.

The suggestion is, are you okay to replace the 42 items with gray color instead? This way we can deliver on time before Chinese Holiday. Please let me know your feedback today
[1/23/26, 3:11:26 PM] Bea (Edamama) V: Beige is actually more sellable than the gray one. What we can do is deliver what's available per color and we'll just pay whatever will be the final quantity ‎<This message was edited>
[1/23/26, 4:03:53 PM] Ash: Hi Bea, this is noted. I will inform the supplier
[1/26/26, 4:02:05 PM] ~ Cj: Hi @⁨Ash⁩ and @⁨Gail - Lanturn⁩ , do we have any updates on the play gym orders?
[1/26/26, 4:02:51 PM] ~ Cj: Also, if we have the initial selection for the cottonkind project?
[1/26/26, 4:06:10 PM] Ash: The sewing work is complete; we are now waiting for the labels to be produced before packaging. I will share the updated lead time here once supplier confirmed
[1/26/26, 4:06:40 PM] Ash: I’ll share the actual numbers of play gym
[1/26/26, 4:07:06 PM] ~ Cj: Thanks Ash, just want to make sure that the items will be shipped before the holiday.
[1/26/26, 4:08:11 PM] Ash: That’s the goal, to send the play gym before the holiday
