Please meet Syuen @⁨Hui Syuen⁩ , who will be taking the lead on managing all requests and feedback for the Bala Di Gala project. She will also be sharing the updated quotation based on the requirements you provided yesterday. 🙌
[28/10/2025, 4:37:08 AM] ~ Jorge: Hello Sourcy team! 

Just touching base to know if you had any questions regarding the file we shared and if we could get an estimate date of when we can see your proposed articles with moqs and prices. 

Thanks!
[28/10/2025, 9:11:57 AM] Eugene Clarance Sourcy: Thanks Jorge! The team @⁨Hui Syuen⁩ @⁨Michael Sourcy⁩ is working on it!

We’ll get back to you with more comments tomorrow morning, but looking at the designs at a glance I see a lot of products that I Like!

[29/10/2025, 1:25:43 AM] ~ Ruben De La Rosa: Hi Team,

Hope you’re all doing well.

We’d like to request your support to produce a batch of dust bags, approximately 36 cm x 36 cm in size.

I’m sharing a photo and the logo to be used for the print design — the logo should measure 2.1 cm in height and 26 cm in width.

We’d really appreciate it if you could have them ready as soon as possible, as we’d like this to be one of the first items we start working on together.

If you need any additional details, please let us know — we’ll be glad to provide them.

Ideally, the shipment could be sent by air, and it would be great if you could share an estimated shipping date based on that method.

Additionally, Jorge has asked Mariana and me to review the bag proposal you sent earlier. We’ll be getting back to you shortly with an initial order.

Thanks so much for your help and cooperation.

Best,
Rubén

We’re completely flexible and open to whatever option is most feasible in terms of time and price.

Thanks so much for your help and collaboration — we really appreciate it.
[29/10/2025, 9:55:00 AM] Hui Syuen: Hi @⁨~Ruben De La Rosa⁩, noted on the above. May I know if you have any desired quantity for dust bag?
[29/10/2025, 10:00:31 AM] ~ Jorge: Hello @⁨Hui Syuen⁩ if you can help us quote, the MOQ and then maybe 5,000 and 10,000 dust bags we can get an idea of The Price difference and decide From There.

[29/10/2025, 10:45:17 PM] ~ Ruben De La Rosa: Sure! Here’s the full shipping address for the logistics cost calculation:

Calle: Presa Nueva de Jalpa 157A
Col.: Rivera de la Presa
C.P.: 37100
City: León, Guanajuato
Country: Mexico
[29/10/2025, 11:14:30 PM] ~ Ruben De La Rosa: Hi team, thanks for sharing the quotation and the photos.

We’ve reviewed the pricing, and honestly it’s not viable for us right now — we’re currently buying the same dust bags here in Mexico for around $24 MXN each (about USD $1.40).

It would be incredible if you could offer us more economical options, as we’re looking for something in the range of USD $0.25–$0.35 per piece.

If there’s any flexibility or alternative materials that could help reduce cost, we’d be happy to review them and move forward.

[03/11/2025, 7:23:28 AM] ~ Ruben De La Rosa: Hi team,

Thank you very much for the information and for updating the quotation.

We’d really appreciate it if you could add both additional sizes to the quotation, for both materials (faux silk satin and non-woven):
	•	35 cm × 45 cm
	•	60 cm × 40 cm

Additionally, we’d like to request that you include an air freight (by air) quotation as well, considering a minimum order quantity of 2,500 pieces, if possible.

Please let us know once you have the updated version.

Thanks again for your support and time.
[03/11/2025, 7:43:54 AM] ~ Ruben De La Rosa: We’d also like to proceed with physical samples for the following models from the previous quotation: rows 1, 2, 3, 11, 14, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, and 28.

Please make sure that all samples are produced in the same color as shown in the images.

Once you share the total cost of the samples, we’ll request our payments department to process the transfer immediately.

Additionally, we’d appreciate it if you could provide the DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) pricing for these models, to have full landed cost visibility.

Both the samples and the full order will need to be shipped by air, so that everything can arrive in Mexico within December.

Once we receive and review the samples, we’ll be ready to move forward with our first full order.

Thank you again for your time and support.

Thank you very much for the updated quotation and all the information you shared. After reviewing it internally and considering our current timelines, we’ve decided that it won’t be feasible to place a first order for the dust bags this year.

We truly appreciate your support and attention, and we hope to resume the conversation regarding the dust bags early next year.
[07/11/2025, 1:46:29 AM] ~ Ruben De La Rosa: Hi @⁨Desaura (Sourcy)⁩,

I’d like to check whether you’ve received the sample package. According to the FedEx tracking, it was delivered yesterday. Could you kindly confirm? 😊
[03/12/2025, 11:47:42 AM] ~ Ruben De La Rosa: Hi @⁨Desaura (Sourcy)⁩, thank you very much for your message.

I can confirm that the sample package has already been received at our warehouse. Tomorrow we will be reviewing everything and will get back to you with our feedback and, if everything is in order, with the details of a first order.

We are very much looking forward to building a long-term, high-impact working relationship together.

[11/12/2025, 3:09:53 AM] ~ Ruben De La Rosa: @⁨Desaura (Sourcy)⁩, thank you again for sending the samples and for your follow-up.

We’ve reviewed everything internally, and after evaluating the samples in detail, we’ve determined that none of them fully align with what we’re looking to launch for the brand at this stage. We prefer to close this cycle with full clarity, and at the beginning of next year we’ll reach out again to continue the exploration process and review new alternatives together.

We truly appreciate your time, support, and willingness throughout the process.
I’ll stay in touch.
[12/12/2025, 8:55:09 AM] Desaura (Sourcy): Hi Ruben @⁨~Ruben De La Rosa⁩ , thank you for the update and for reviewing the samples so thoroughly.

To help us improve and better support you for the next cycle, could you kindly share the specific reasons why the samples didn’t meet the expectations this time?
If there were any concerns related to quality, design, functionality, or timeline, we’d really appreciate your feedback. Understanding this will help us refine our approach and present more aligned options for your brand moving forward.

Thank you again for your time and support. Looking forward to collaborating again in 2026
[16/12/2025, 8:09:34 AM] ~ Ruben De La Rosa: Hi @⁨Desaura (Sourcy)⁩, thank you for following up.

First, the positives: Sourcy’s attention and support were excellent, the turnaround was very fast, and your team’s responsiveness was outstanding. Also, all samples matched what we requested.

That said, in this round the materials and some design details are still not exactly aligned with what we are looking for for Bala Di Gala. They are definitely a great starting point. Based on our review, we selected 4 options that are the closest in terms of quality and construction to something viable for us, and we’d like to focus the next iteration on those.

If it works for you, we can reconnect in the third week of January to review those 4 and define the next steps.

I’ll stay in touch.
[17/12/2025, 8:12:46 AM] Desaura (Sourcy): Hi Ruben, thank you so much for the detailed feedback, really appreciate it and am glad to hear there are few samples met your initial requests.

For the items that weren’t approved, may we ask what felt misaligned (material, model/design, or other aspects)? This would help us improve, and please let us know if you’d be open to exploring alternative options for those.

For the 4 selected items, we’re happy to proceed, are there any specific requests or adjustments you’d like us to consider before the next step in January? The third week of January works well on our side 😊 ‎<This message was edited>
[17/12/2025, 9:27:01 AM] Desaura (Sourcy): Also, @⁨~Ruben De La Rosa⁩ , i’d like to check which 4 items were selected as the closest match to your standards. Could you please let us know which products those are?
[12/01/2026, 10:28:20 PM] Desaura (Sourcy): Hi @⁨~Ruben De La Rosa⁩  @⁨~Mariana⁩ @⁨~Jorge⁩,
Happy New Year! 🎉 Hope you’re all doing well and had a great start to the year.

We wanted to check in regarding the women’s bags project and see if you’re still interested in continuing, as it’s already mid of January and Chinese New Year will be in the second week of February. We'd like to confirm soon so we can make sure we’re able to deliver everything you need without any delays before CNY.

We’re very open to arranging a call or Google Meet if you’d like to discuss the next steps or any updates in more detail.
Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks! 😊
