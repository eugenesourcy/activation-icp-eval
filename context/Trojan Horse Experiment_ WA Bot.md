Raw chats of Growth Team: [Chat history](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QgXbcRgxfLf2Yy7PN8khrRxnRa7VThff)

**1 Summary of what we learned and what matters for Michael and the WA bot**

* Most inbound, outbound, referral leads do not start by “submitting an SR.” They start by testing feasibility and trust through commercial questions  
* The most common early questions are price, MOQ, whether delivery is included, and requests for catalog or proof of quality  
* Our conversion to a high-quality SR depends on two things happening in the same conversation  
  * We answer the customer’s first trust questions quickly  
  * We collect the minimum inputs needed to avoid wasting sourcing effort or quoting the wrong thing  
* The biggest operational failures happen when we start sourcing or quoting while the product definition is still unclear, or when key constraints show up late (customization, MOQ, compliance, logistics)

*Michael and the WA bot should follow the same SOP and use the same assets so the customer experience is consistent regardless of who handles the chat*

**Type of customers:**

Ready buyers with clear requirements

* They already know what they want and can share a reference, specs, or a clear description quickly  
* They mainly want a fast answer on feasibility, pricing, MOQ, delivery, and how to proceed

Semi-clear buyers who know the category but need confidence before committing

* They know the general product they want but still need validation on price, MOQ, delivery, and quality  
* They usually ask for catalog, photos, or talk about samples before they provide full details or company info

Unclear buyers who do not have a reference and cannot describe requirements

* They want to source something, they can specify the product category, but cannot specify what specs should be  
* no reference photo or link  
* no style direction (material, type, target market, examples)  
* no quantity or budget  
* Without guidance, they often cannot convert into an SR in chat

**2 What customers ask first and how they usually behave**

* Customers usually start by naming the product or category they want  
* Very quickly they ask questions that tell us whether they will continue or drop  
  * What is the price per unit  
  * What is the MOQ  
  * Can you deliver to my location and is delivery included in the price?  
* Some customers (10-20%) want a call as the trust step instead of asking many questions in chat  
* Some customers asks to share a catalog or photos and explain how we ensure the quality  
* Only after they get a useful answer do they usually agree to share company details and contact information

**3 What this means for our SOP and what we should have ready**

* We should expect “commercial trust questions” early and respond directly instead of pushing intake questions too early  
* We should have prepared and reusable materials that match what customers actually ask for  
  * Category catalogs or curated option lists that are easy to share  
  * A standard way to explain pricing, especially what is included and what is not included  
  * A standard way to explain logistics mechanism  
  * A standard way to explain MOQ and what changes MOQ, especially customization  
  * A standard way to explain how we validate quality, what sampling can and cannot guarantee, and what proof we can share  
* Sending a long company deck is not the main trust lever shown in these chats  
  * If we want to send credibility content, it should be short and directly tied to the customer’s question at first  
  * Example: a short message explaining how we ensure quality and how shipping works, plus a relevant catalog snippet  
  * A full profile deck and case studies should be optional and only used when the customer asks “who are you” or wants a call and needs reassurance

**4 What good chats look like**

* They answer the customer’s question first, especially about price, MOQ, delivery, and quality  
* They turn the conversation into a clear SR by collecting the minimum required inputs step by step  
  * Reference photo or link, or a very clear description  
  * Quantity and budget or target price  
  * Destination country and city  
  * Timeline and whether customization is required  
* They confirm what the customer actually wants before starting sourcing so we do not work on the wrong item  
* They keep momentum by stating a clear next step  
  * What we will send next and what we need from the customer to do it  
* They do not block leads just because the customer does not have a website or social page

**5 What bad chats look like**

* We repeat what the customer said but do not convert it into clear inputs that enable action  
* We start sourcing or quoting before confirming the product definition, which causes wrong outcomes and frustration  
* We give pricing that does not match the customer’s expectation because they meant delivered price but we gave product-only price  
* We ask for too many “SRs fields” before providing any value, which makes the customer drop  
* We reject a lead without explaining what minimum information is needed to proceed or what we can do instead  
* We create confusion by sending conflicting messages or delayed responses after the customer already replied

**6 The recommended chat flow to convert more high-quality SR**

**![][image1]**

* Step 1 Confirm the product request quickly  
  * Ask what product they want and request a reference photo or link  
  * If no reference, ask for the few minimum details needed to define minimal item category clearly  
* Step 2 asks or answer the first commercial questions and collect key inputs at the same time  
  * Respond to their questions about price, MOQ, delivery, and quality in a simple way  
  * Ask for quantity, budget or target price, destination, timeline, and customization yes or no  
* Step 3 Check feasibility before committing sourcing effort  
  * If the target price is not realistic, say it early and explain what can be changed to make it possible  
* Step 4 Share a useful artifact that builds trust  
  * Send a relevant catalog snippet or a short curated list of options  
  * Share simple quality proof and explain the sampling path when needed  
* Step 5 Collect identity details when the customer is ready to proceed  
  * Name, email, company name, website or none, and location  
* Step 6 Close with a clear SR summary and confirmation  
  * Summarize the request in one block and ask the customer to confirm it is correct  
  * Only after confirmation do we treat it as a valid SR and hand it to sourcing
