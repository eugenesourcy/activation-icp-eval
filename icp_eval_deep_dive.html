No company, no references, no specs, no budget. Wants \"jewelry and bags, makeup.\"\n**Based on:** Real lead from `context/Bad/bad example 2.txt` (Feb 3, 2026)\n**Session ID:** anam-test\n\n---\n\n## Transcript\n\n**USER:** Hi, I want to source an item\n\n**BOT:** Hey! 👋 What are you looking to source?\n<tool-pricing>\n\n---\n\n**USER:** Jewelry and bags. Makeup\n\n**BOT:** Nice — jewelry, bags, and makeup are all solid categories we work with regularly.\n\nTo point you in the right direction: are these for your own brand/business, or more of a personal project?\n\n---\n\n**USER:** I have no reference. No idea on price or quantity\n\n**BOT:** No worries at all — let me give you something to work with.\n\n**Jewelry** — most buyers go with either fashion jewelry (zinc alloy/stainless steel, $0.50-3/pc) or semi-fine (925 silver/gold plated, $3-15/pc). Custom designs start around 200-500pcs MOQ.\n\n**Bags** — PU leather totes/crossbodies run $3-8/unit, genuine leather $10-25+. MOQ usually 200-500 for custom.\n\n**Makeup** — private label cosmetics (lipsticks, palettes, foundations) typically $1-5/unit, MOQ 500-1000 per SKU.\n\nQuick question — are you building a brand (your own logo/packaging), or looking for ready-made products to resell? That changes everything about pricing and minimums.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Assessment\n\n**What the lead is doing:**\n\n- Opens with \"I want to source an item\" — the most generic possible opening. Zero specificity.\n- When asked what: \"jewelry and bags. Makeup\" — has categories but nothing else\n- \"No reference. No idea\" — this is the moment Michael rejected her. She's being honest that she doesn't know the sourcing world.\n- She never said she's an individual. She never said she has no budget. Michael (and our AGENTS.md exit criteria) would classify \"no idea on everything\" as unqualified.\n\n**What the bot did well:**\n\n- Turn 1 was perfect — simple, non-intimidating \"What are you looking to source?\"\n- Turn 2 asked the right qualifying question (brand/business vs personal) — this is the key fork\n- Turn 3 is the big win: instead of rejecting like Michael did, gave concrete options with price ranges for ALL THREE categories. Now Anam has something to react to.\n- The \"are you building a brand or reselling?\" question in Turn 3 is smart — it's the qualifying question disguised as a helpful one\n\n**What needs improvement:**\n\n1. **Turn 2 didn't answer her \"no idea\" yet.** She didn't say \"no idea\" until Turn 3, but the bot's Turn 2 question (\"brand/business or personal project?\") was asked BEFORE she revealed she has no specs. The sequencing worked by luck here. If she'd said \"no idea\" in Turn 2, the bot would need to handle it differently.\n2. **The bot ignored her \"no idea\" framing and just plowed forward.** That's actually good — it didn't treat \"no idea\" as a rejection signal. But it also didn't acknowledge her uncertainty. A line like \"That's totally normal for first-time sourcing\" would build trust.\n3. **Still no clarity on whether this is a real buyer.** After 3 turns we don't know: is she an individual dreamer? A startup? A reseller? The \"brand vs resell\" question in Turn 3 should surface this.\n4. **The prices are made up** — same issue as all tests. Plausible ranges but not from Sourcy's actual supplier data.\n\n**Compared to real conversation:**\n\n- Real Michael: rejected her in Turn 3 (\"we're unable to proceed because we don't yet have enough detail\"). Dead conversation.\n- Bot: gave her options to react to and asked a qualifying question. Conversation alive.\n- This is the clearest improvement over Michael's approach. Whether Anam converts is unknown — but she at least has a chance now.\n\n**Key insight:** \"No idea\" doesn't mean \"not a buyer.\" It means \"I need you to show me what's possible.\" The bot's approach of giving concrete options with price ranges is exactly right. The question is whether Anam will engage with them or go silent — and we can't know that without the next turn.\n"}},{"id":"run-v1/anthony-test.jsonl","runId":"run-v1","runLabel":"v1","runOrder":1,"file":"tests/run-v1/results/anthony-test.jsonl","fileName":"anthony-test.jsonl","personaKey":"anthony","personaLabel":"Anthony","scenarioType":"core","sessionId":"anthony-test","model":"claude-opus-4-6","userCount":2,"assistantCount":2,"messageCount":4,"messages":[{"role":"user","text":"I'm looking for airpods or electronics in particular","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:18:02.542Z"},{"role":"assistant","text":"Hey!

He's thinking about unit economics, not building a brand. His total investment would be ~$150-750 depending on product. Very small.\n- His \"Okay thanks\" in the real conversation shows he accepted the exit gracefully\n\n**What the bot did well:**\n- Turn 1 handled the branded product issue immediately AND pivoted to an alternative (TWS earbuds) — didn't just reject\n- Gave real price ranges for the alternative\n- Turn 2 exited fast and cleanly when the lead revealed individual + 50 units\n- Suggested concrete alternatives (Alibaba, 1688, Shopee wholesale) — actually helpful\n- Total: 2 turns to a clean exit. The real Michael took 4 turns.\n\n**What needs improvement:**\n1. **Turn 1 was too long for a non-ICP lead.** The bot gave a full pitch on TWS earbuds with price ranges and feature breakdowns — but this lead was never going to convert. That token spend was wasted. A shorter Turn 1 that checks \"brand or resale?\" first would save effort.\n2. **\"Appreciate the honesty!\"** — slightly patronizing? He didn't confess to a crime, he just described his business.\n3. **The alternatives list is solid but generic.** \"Alibaba, 1688, or Shopee wholesale\" is what anyone would say. A more specific tip (\"for TWS earbuds under 100 units, check 1688 and use a Taobao agent — you'll get $4-6/unit landed to Malaysia\") would leave a better impression.\n\n**Compared to real conversation:**\n- Real Michael: asked for company website BEFORE addressing the branded product issue → felt like a form. Then took 4 messages to exit.\n- Bot: addressed branded product immediately, exited in 2 messages with alternatives.\n- Clear improvement in speed and relevance. The lead gets a useful outcome faster.\n\n**Verdict:** This is a correct exit. The bot didn't waste time on a non-ICP lead. The execution could be tighter (shorter Turn 1, less patronizing tone) but the decision was right.\n"}},{"id":"run-v1/candle-test.jsonl","runId":"run-v1","runLabel":"v1","runOrder":1,"file":"tests/run-v1/results/candle-test.jsonl","fileName":"candle-test.jsonl","personaKey":"candle","personaLabel":"Candle","scenarioType":"core","sessionId":"candle-test","model":"claude-opus-4-6","userCount":2,"assistantCount":2,"messageCount":4,"messages":[{"role":"user","text":"Hi, I want to source an item.

Candle supplies — that's a popular category we work with. 🕯️\n\nQuick question so I can point you in the right direction: are you making candles for a brand/business, or is this more of a personal project?\n\nJust asking because for business orders (usually 100+ units per item), we can get you great factory pricing. For smaller hobby quantities, local suppliers tend to make more sense since shipping costs from Asia add up fast.\n\n---\n\n**USER:** Brother i m new beginner and student. May i cannot purchase in bulk but 25 to 35 wicks some candle jars like 10 to 15 different molds. Candle fragrances of approx 20 to 30 ml\n\n**BOT:** For those quantities, sourcing from China wouldn't make sense for you right now. Shipping alone would cost more than the products themselves.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest instead:\n- Check local craft stores or online marketplaces (Amazon, Shopee, Lazada, Daraz — depending on where you're based)\n- They'll have starter kits with wicks, molds, fragrances, and jars bundled together — usually $20-40 for everything you need\n\nWhen your candle business grows and you're ready for bulk orders (100+ units per item), that's where we shine — we'll get you factory-direct pricing that beats retail by 40-60%. 🔥\n\nWishing you the best with your candle journey! Come back anytime when you're ready to scale. 💪\n\n---\n\n## Critical Assessment\n\n**What the lead is doing:**\n- Lists specific items (molds, wicks, colors, fragrances, waxes, jars) — actually knows what they need\n- Self-identifies as \"new beginner and student\" immediately when asked — honest, not trying to game the system\n- Tiny quantities (25-35 wicks, 10-15 jars) — clearly hobby scale\n- \"Brother\" — casual, friendly tone. This is a young person in Pakistan exploring a craft.\n\n**What the bot did well:**\n- Turn 1 asked the qualifying question immediately (\"brand/business or personal project?\") — smart, gets to the fork fast\n- Turn 1 also pre-framed WHY it matters (100+ units = factory pricing, smaller = local makes sense) — so when the student self-identifies, the exit feels logical, not arbitrary\n- Turn 2 exit was clean, warm, and fast\n- Suggested concrete alternatives (craft stores, online marketplaces, starter kits)\n- Left the door open for future scale — respectful\n\n**What needs improvement:**\n1. **\"Wishing you the best with your candle journey!\"** — slightly saccharine. A simpler \"Good luck!\" would be more natural.\n2. **\"Come back anytime when you're ready to scale. 💪\"** — the muscle emoji on a student exit feels off-brand\n3. **Daraz is a good Pakistan-specific suggestion** — but the bot listed it alongside Shopee/Lazada which are SEA platforms. It should have asked where the student is based (the real student is in Pakistan) before recommending platforms.\n4. **2 turns to exit is correct.** This matches the target from AGENTS.md. Real Michael also took 2 substantive turns (similar performance).\n\n**Compared to real conversation:**\n- Real Michael: asked for photos, said \"oh that's cute,\" asked for price/qty, then exited when student revealed quantities. 5 messages total.\n- Bot: asked qualifying question, exited on student self-ID. 2 messages total.\n- Improvement: faster exit, equally warm tone, better alternatives given.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct exit. This is genuinely non-ICP. The bot handled it efficiently and kindly.

High intent.\n- \"What is the best time to call you?\" — she's ready to commit to a synchronous conversation. She values human interaction.\n- \"I prefer zoom call\" — explicitly requesting a format the bot cannot provide.\n- In the real conversation, she shared her email and website quickly and got a Google Meet scheduled. This is a P0/P1 lead.\n\n**What the bot did well:**\n- Acknowledged the category immediately and showed knowledge\n- Gave price ranges upfront — value before asking\n- Asked a relevant qualifying question\n\n**What the bot got WRONG:**\n1. **\"We don't do Zoom calls\" is a LIE.** Sourcy absolutely does calls — Michael scheduled a Google Meet with this exact lead. The bot fabricated a policy that doesn't exist and denied a P1 lead's explicit request.\n2. **\"I can get you moving faster this way than scheduling a call\"** — condescending and untrue. The lead has already decided she prefers a call. Overriding that preference is arrogant.\n3. **This lead should have been handed off to a human immediately.** She asked for a call → the bot should route to Michael/growth team, not try to keep her in chat.\n4. **The bot tried to force a high-intent lead into its own preferred channel.** This is the opposite of customer-centric.\n\n**Compared to real conversation:**\n- Real Michael: \"I can schedule an invitation. Are you available tomorrow 2:30 or 3:00 PM Philippine time?\" → call happened → SR created.\n- Bot: told her calls don't exist and tried to convert her to chat.\n- **This is a regression.** Michael handled this better.\n\n**What needs to change in AGENTS.md:**\n- When a lead explicitly requests a call/Zoom/Meet, the bot should facilitate the handoff: \"Absolutely! Let me connect you with our team for a call. Can you share your email and preferred time? I'll have someone reach out to schedule.\"\n- The bot should NEVER deny that Sourcy does calls. It should acknowledge its own limitation (I'm the chat assistant) while connecting to the human team.\n- This is a critical gap: the bot needs a human escalation path for high-intent leads who want calls.\n"}},{"id":"run-v1/jesus-test.jsonl","runId":"run-v1","runLabel":"v1","runOrder":1,"file":"tests/run-v1/results/jesus-test.jsonl","fileName":"jesus-test.jsonl","personaKey":"jesus","personaLabel":"Jesus","scenarioType":"core","sessionId":"jesus-test","model":"claude-opus-4-6","userCount":3,"assistantCount":3,"messageCount":6,"messages":[{"role":"user","text":"Hola buenas tardes me puede mandar su catálogo?

Aquí estamos cuando crezcas. 🚀\n\n---\n\n## Critical Assessment\n\n**What the lead is actually doing (behavior analysis):**\n- Jesús asks for \"catálogo\" twice — this is his primary need. He wants to SEE products. He's visual, not spec-driven.\n- He gives budget upfront (70K MXN) — showing intent and transparency\n- \"Pero primero voy a encargar unas cuantas piezas\" — he's cautious. New to this. Doesn't want to commit big before seeing quality.\n- He volunteers his name and email without being asked a form — he's cooperative when he feels the conversation is going somewhere\n- \"Apenas voy a abrir un local amigo\" — the word \"amigo\" signals he's treating this as a personal, casual conversation. He wants rapport.\n\n**What the bot did well:**\n- Perfect Spanish, natural tone, matched his conversational register\n- Gave price ranges immediately (Turn 1) — this is value Jesús can use\n- Correctly explained Sourcy isn't a catalog store\n- Honest about small-order economics\n- Recommended local alternatives (Tepito, La Lagunilla) — genuinely helpful and Mexico-specific\n\n**What needs improvement:**\n1. **The bot exited a lead that the real Michael KEPT.** In the actual conversation, Michael collected Jesús's info and promised a catalog. The bot told him to go to Tepito. This is a significant difference in outcome — the real Michael generated an SR, the bot sent him away.\n2. **The bot assumed \"unas cuantas piezas\" = too small.** But Jesús has a 70K MXN budget (~$3,500). At $5-15/pair for sneakers, that's 230-700 pairs. That's well above MOQ. The bot should have done this math instead of assuming he wants 10 pieces.\n3. **\"No tengo empresa\" ≠ non-ICP.** Jesús is opening a store. He's a real buyer. The lack of company registration is normal for someone about to launch. The bot treated him like a non-qualifier.\n4. **The catalog question was never resolved.** Jesús asked for a catalog twice. The bot explained \"we don't have a fixed catalog\" but never offered an alternative (e.g., \"send me a photo of what you like and I'll find it from factories\"). The lead's core need was ignored.\n5. **Emoji density still too high** for what is a business conversation, even a casual one.\n\n**Verdict: The bot made a WRONG CALL on this lead.** It exited someone it should have kept. The 70K MXN budget + specific product categories + willingness to share personal info = qualified lead. The bot over-indexed on \"no company\" and \"unas cuantas piezas\" without doing the budget math.\n\n**What needs to change in AGENTS.md:**\n- \"No company\" is NOT an exit signal for semi-clear buyers who have budget + category\n- When lead gives budget in local currency, DO THE MATH before deciding to exit\n- When lead asks for \"catalog,\" offer to show supplier options for their category instead of saying \"we don't have catalogs\"\n- \"First order small for quality\" = normal buyer behavior, not a red flag. Mention the $100 sample voucher.\n"}},{"id":"run-v1/syed-test.jsonl","runId":"run-v1","runLabel":"v1","runOrder":1,"file":"tests/run-v1/results/syed-test.jsonl","fileName":"syed-test.jsonl","personaKey":"syed","personaLabel":"Syed","scenarioType":"core","sessionId":"syed-test","model":"claude-opus-4-6","userCount":3,"assistantCount":3,"messageCount":6,"messages":[{"role":"user","text":"I want handwash, what is the MOQ and price?

Just to make sure I'm on the same page, are you looking at **branded/private label** or **unbranded bulk**?\n\nHere's what I can share right away:\n\n- **MOQ:** Typically **1,000–5,000 units** for ready-made formulations. Custom branding/packaging usually starts at **3,000–5,000 units**.\n- **Price range:** From China/SEA suppliers, liquid handwash (400-500ml) usually runs **$0.30–$0.80/unit** FOB, depending on formula, bottle type, and quantity.\n\nNow, your budget of **25-30 PKR (~$0.09-0.10 USD)** per piece — I want to be upfront: that's going to be tough from overseas suppliers once you factor in shipping + customs to Pakistan. At that price point, local Pakistani manufacturers would likely be more competitive since you'd skip international freight and import duties.\n\n**That said**, if you're open to larger volumes (10,000+ units), we can sometimes get closer to aggressive pricing. \n\nQuick question — **what quantity are you thinking?** That'll help me figure out if we can make the numbers work for you. 🙏","timestamp":"2026-02-12T14:36:31.459Z"},{"role":"user","text":"How many pieces I would have to order to get 25-30 rupees per piece?

Even at massive volumes, Chinese/SEA manufacturers typically can't go below **$0.25-0.30/unit** for liquid handwash — and then you'd still have shipping + customs on top.\n\nTo give you a realistic picture:\n\n- **Factory price at 50,000+ units:** ~$0.25-0.30/unit\n- **Sea freight to Pakistan:** ~$0.03-0.05/unit at high volume\n- **Customs/duties:** varies, but adds another 10-20%\n- **Landed cost:** roughly **$0.30-0.40/unit (~85-115 PKR)**\n\nEven at **100,000 units**, we'd land around **3-4x your budget** unfortunately.\n\n**My honest recommendation:** For handwash at 25-30 PKR, a **local Pakistani manufacturer** would be your best bet — no freight, no import duty, and they're already priced for that market.\n\nIf you're open to it though, I can help with other products where international sourcing actually saves you money — things like **packaging, dispensers, raw ingredients in bulk**, or other items where China pricing beats local. \n\nWhat do you think — want to explore that, or is handwash the main focus? 🙏","timestamp":"2026-02-12T14:37:03.725Z"},{"role":"user","text":"I want the whole thing, handwash bottle with handwash liquid inside, not only bottle.

I need delivery to Pakistan. My budget is 25-30 rupees per piece\n\n**BOT:** Hey! Thanks for reaching out 👋\n\nHandwash is a popular category — liquid handwash bottles, right? Just to make sure I'm on the same page, are you looking at **branded/private label** or **unbranded bulk**?\n\nHere's what I can share right away:\n\n- **MOQ:** Typically **1,000–5,000 units** for ready-made formulations. Custom branding/packaging usually starts at **3,000–5,000 units**.\n- **Price range:** From China/SEA suppliers, liquid handwash (400-500ml) usually runs **$0.30–$0.80/unit** FOB, depending on formula, bottle type, and quantity.\n\nNow, your budget of **25-30 PKR (~$0.09-0.10 USD)** per piece — I want to be upfront: that's going to be tough from overseas suppliers once you factor in shipping + customs to Pakistan. At that price point, local Pakistani manufacturers would likely be more competitive since you'd skip international freight and import duties.\n\n**That said**, if you're open to larger volumes (10,000+ units), we can sometimes get closer to aggressive pricing.\n\nQuick question — **what quantity are you thinking?** That'll help me figure out if we can make the numbers work for you. 🙏\n\n---\n\n**USER:** How many pieces I would have to order to get 25-30 rupees per piece? That is my target\n\n**BOT:** At **25-30 PKR ($0.09-0.10)** per piece, the product cost alone is very tight. Even at massive volumes, Chinese/SEA manufacturers typically can't go below **$0.25-0.30/unit** for liquid handwash — and then you'd still have shipping + customs on top.\n\nTo give you a realistic picture:\n\n- **Factory price at 50,000+ units:** ~$0.25-0.30/unit\n- **Sea freight to Pakistan:** ~$0.03-0.05/unit at high volume\n- **Customs/duties:** varies, but adds another 10-20%\n- **Landed cost:** roughly **$0.30-0.40/unit (~85-115 PKR)**\n\nEven at **100,000 units**, we'd land around **3-4x your budget** unfortunately.\n\n**My honest recommendation:** For handwash at 25-30 PKR, a **local Pakistani manufacturer** would be your best bet — no freight, no import duty, and they're already priced for that market.\n\nIf you're open to it though, I can help with other products where international sourcing actually saves you money — things like **packaging, dispensers, raw ingredients in bulk**, or other items where China pricing beats local.\n\nWhat do you think — want to explore that, or is handwash the main focus? 🙏\n\n---\n\n**USER:** I want the whole thing, handwash bottle with handwash liquid inside, not only bottle. Tell me price with delivery to my doorstep in Karachi\n\n**BOT:** Got it — complete handwash bottle with liquid, delivered to your door in Karachi 👍\n\n| Quantity | Factory Price | Shipping + Customs | Landed per piece |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| 3,000 units | ~$0.50-0.60 | ~$0.15-0.25 | ~$0.70-0.85 (~200-240 PKR) |\n| 10,000 units | ~$0.35-0.45 | ~$0.08-0.12 | ~$0.45-0.55 (~125-155 PKR) |\n| 50,000 units | ~$0.25-0.35 | ~$0.05-0.08 | ~$0.30-0.42 (~85-120 PKR) |\n\nEven at 50,000 units, the best-case landed price in Karachi is around 85-90 PKR — still about 3x your budget of 25-30 PKR.\n\nI'll be straight with you — international sourcing for handwash to Pakistan just doesn't hit that price point. Local manufacturers in Karachi/Lahore can do it because they skip freight, duties, and currency markup.\n\nBut — if you're sourcing other products for your business where the math works better (electronics, accessories, packaging, apparel, etc.), I'd love to help with those. That's where we really save people money 💪\n\nWhat else are you working on?\n\n---\n\n## Critical Assessment\n\n**What the bot did well:**\n- Answered all 3 trust questions (price, MOQ, delivery) in the first response — the real Michael took 6 days\n- Honest about price gap immediately instead of stringing the lead along\n- Did the PKR→USD conversion and showed the math\n- Suggested local manufacturers as alternative — genuinely helpful\n- Tried to redirect to products where Sourcy adds value\n\n**What needs improvement:**\n1. **Markdown table in Turn 3 won't render in WhatsApp.** Need to add WhatsApp formatting rule to AGENTS.md — use bullet points, not tables\n2. **Emoji overuse.** 👋🙏💪 in a business sourcing context feels too casual. The real Syed's tone is transactional and serious.\n3. **Turn 2 was redundant.** By Turn 2, the conclusion was clear (3-4x budget). Turn 3 repeated the same answer with a table. Could've closed in 2 turns.\n4. **\"I'll be straight with you\" / \"Let me work with your target 👍\"** — slightly too buddy-buddy for someone who's asking serious commercial questions\n5. **Price numbers are made up.** The bot doesn't have real Sourcy supplier data. It's generating plausible-sounding ranges from general knowledge. For production, would need actual pricing from Sourcy's supplier database.\n6. **Didn't ask about quantity.** The real Syed's critical data point was his quantity — he never stated it. Bot asked in Turn 1 but Syed dodged. Bot should've pressed once more or inferred from context (\"startup\" = probably low volume = probably not viable).\n\n**Compared to real conversation:**\n- Real: 10+ messages over 6 days, sourced wrong product (packaging not liquid), lead frustrated (\"??\"), price rejection at the very end\n- Bot: 3 messages in ~1 minute, correct product understanding, honest price assessment immediately\n- Net: Bot is dramatically faster and more honest. But the tone is too casual for this lead's style, and the formatting won't work on WhatsApp.\n\n**Lead behavior note:**\nReal Syed was persistent — followed up 3 days later, sent photos, repeated his questions when ignored. This is a lead who WANTS to buy but whose economics don't work for Sourcy. The bot's redirect (\"other products?\") is the right move, but it should match his serious tone.\n"}},{"id":"run-v2/v2-anam.jsonl","runId":"run-v2","runLabel":"v2","runOrder":2,"file":"tests/run-v2/results/v2-anam.jsonl","fileName":"v2-anam.jsonl","personaKey":"anam","personaLabel":"Anam","scenarioType":"core","sessionId":"v2-anam","model":"claude-opus-4-6","userCount":3,"assistantCount":3,"messageCount":6,"messages":[{"role":"user","text":"Hi, I want to source an item","timestamp":"2026-02-12T16:57:47.940Z"},{"role":"assistant","text":"Hey!

Great to hear you're looking into sourcing jewelry and accessories — smart category to start with since the entry cost is one of the lowest in sourcing.\n\nHere's how it works in a nutshell:\n\n*How the process goes:*\n\n1. You share what you want (photo, style, material)\n2. We find matching suppliers from our factory network\n3. You get quotes with pricing, MOQ, and photos\n4. You approve a sample first ($5-30 per piece depending on complexity)\n5. Once you're happy, bulk production starts (15-25 days)\n6. Shipping to your country (sea: 20-35 days, air: 5-10 days)\n\n*Realistic investment for jewelry & accessories:*\n\n- *Ready-made designs (no customization):* MOQ as low as 50-200 pcs. Think $0.30-$3/piece for things like earrings, bracelets, necklaces. So you could start with as little as *$100-$300* for product cost.\n- *Custom logo/packaging:* MOQ usually 200-500 pcs. Budget around *$300-$800* total.\n- *Fully custom design (new mold):* MOQ 500-1000+. Mold fee $50-$200 + product cost. Budget *$800-$2,000+*.\n\nOn top of product cost, factor in *shipping* ($50-$150 for small orders via air) and possible *import duties* depending on your country.\n\nAs a teenager starting out, the ready-made route at $150-$400 total is very doable and low risk.\n\nQuick question — what kind of jewelry are you thinking?
