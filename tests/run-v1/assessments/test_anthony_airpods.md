## Transcript

**USER:** I'm looking for airpods or electronics in particular

**BOT:** Hey! Thanks for reaching out 👋

Quick heads up — we can't source branded products like Apple AirPods directly, but we **can** help you find high-quality TWS (true wireless) earbuds from manufacturers in China. A lot of brands source their own-label earbuds this way.

To give you an idea: TWS earbuds typically run **$3-15/unit** depending on features — things like ANC (active noise cancellation), Bluetooth version, battery life, and case quality make a big difference in price.

Are you looking to put your own brand on them, or more interested in ready-stock/unbranded units for resale?

**USER:** I'm actually a individual reseller. I'm planning to buy like 50 then sell for like rm5-10 profit

**BOT:** Appreciate the honesty! That helps me give you straight advice 🙏

Right now Sourcy focuses on helping brands and businesses with bulk sourcing — typically **200+ units** minimum. At 50 units, the shipping cost from China would eat into that RM5-10 margin pretty quickly.

For smaller quantities like that, you'd probably get better deals on **Alibaba, 1688 (with an agent), or even Shopee wholesale** — less overhead, faster turnaround.

When you're ready to scale up to larger orders, we'd love to help! Feel free to reach out anytime 🤝

## Critical Assessment

**What the lead is doing:**
- Opens with a branded product request (AirPods) — tells us immediately he's thinking consumer retail, not B2B sourcing
- Honest about being an individual reseller when asked — doesn't try to fake being a company
- "50 units, RM 5-10 profit" — this is reseller math. He's thinking about unit economics, not building a brand. His total investment would be ~$150-750 depending on product. Very small.
- His "Okay thanks" in the real conversation shows he accepted the exit gracefully

**What the bot did well:**
- Turn 1 handled the branded product issue immediately AND pivoted to an alternative (TWS earbuds) — didn't just reject
- Gave real price ranges for the alternative
- Turn 2 exited fast and cleanly when the lead revealed individual + 50 units
- Suggested concrete alternatives (Alibaba, 1688, Shopee wholesale) — actually helpful
- Total: 2 turns to a clean exit. The real Michael took 4 turns.

**What needs improvement:**
1. **Turn 1 was too long for a non-ICP lead.** The bot gave a full pitch on TWS earbuds with price ranges and feature breakdowns — but this lead was never going to convert. That token spend was wasted. A shorter Turn 1 that checks "brand or resale?" first would save effort.
2. **"Appreciate the honesty!"** — slightly patronizing? He didn't confess to a crime, he just described his business.
3. **The alternatives list is solid but generic.** "Alibaba, 1688, or Shopee wholesale" is what anyone would say. A more specific tip ("for TWS earbuds under 100 units, check 1688 and use a Taobao agent — you'll get $4-6/unit landed to Malaysia") would leave a better impression.

**Compared to real conversation:**
- Real Michael: asked for company website BEFORE addressing the branded product issue → felt like a form. Then took 4 messages to exit.
- Bot: addressed branded product immediately, exited in 2 messages with alternatives.
- Clear improvement in speed and relevance. The lead gets a useful outcome faster.

**Verdict:** This is a correct exit. The bot didn't waste time on a non-ICP lead. The execution could be tighter (shorter Turn 1, less patronizing tone) but the decision was right.
