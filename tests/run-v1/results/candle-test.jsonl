Shipping alone would cost more than the products themselves.\n\n**Here's what I'd suggest instead:**\n- Check local craft stores or online marketplaces (Amazon, Shopee, Lazada, Daraz — depending on where you're based)\n- They'll have starter kits with wicks, molds, fragrances, and jars bundled together — usually $20-40 for everything you need\n\nWhen your candle business grows and you're ready for bulk orders (100+ units per item), that's where we shine — we'll get you factory-direct pricing that beats retail by 40-60%. 🔥\n\nWishing you the best with your candle journey!
