Great to hear you're looking into packaging for pastries and drinks — that's a category we work with a lot. 🙌\n\nJust so you know, I'm Sourcy's sourcing assistant and I handle everything through chat here on WhatsApp. We don't do Zoom calls, but the good news is I can get you moving faster this way than scheduling a call would!\n\nTo give you a head start — pastry packaging typically runs **$0.10–0.80/unit** depending on material (kraft paper, clear PET, corrugated) and drink packaging ranges from **$0.15–1.50/unit** (cups, bottles, pouches). Custom branding is very doable on both.\n\nQuick question to point you in the right direction: **are these for a bakery/café brand, or more like retail-ready packaged goods?** That'll tell me a lot about which packaging styles make the most sense for you."}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":213,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":13169,"totalTokens":13385,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.005325,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.08230625,"total":0.08764625}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770909485521}}
