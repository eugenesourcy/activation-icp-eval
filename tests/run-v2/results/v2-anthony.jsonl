Let me be real with you though — at 50 units, international sourcing from China likely won't make sense for your margins.\n\nHere's why: shipping alone (sea freight + customs) would add *$2-5/unit* to your cost, which eats most of that RM5-10 profit. And most factory MOQs for TWS earbuds start at 200+.\n\nFor quantities like 50, you'd get better pricing from:\n\n- *Shopee/Lazada wholesale sellers* (local stock, no shipping delay)\n- *1688.com* with a consolidator in China\n- Local wholesale markets in KL\n\nWhen you're ready to scale to *200+ units*, that's where we can really help — factory-direct pricing, custom branding, and better per-unit costs.
