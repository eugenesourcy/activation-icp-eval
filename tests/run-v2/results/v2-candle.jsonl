Starting a candle business as a student is exciting.\n\nI want to be straight with you though — for these quantities, international sourcing from China won't make sense. The shipping cost alone would be more than the products themselves at this scale.\n\nFor 25-35 wicks, 10-15 jars, and small fragrance bottles, you'd be much better off with:\n\n- *Amazon or local craft stores* — best for starter kits\n- *Alibaba/1688* — some sellers do small sample packs\n- *Local wholesale markets* in your city\n\nThese options get you started faster, cheaper, and without the headache of international shipping minimums.\n\nWhen you've tested your candles and are ready to scale up (100+ jars, bulk wax by the kg, custom molds), that's where we shine — we'll get you factory-direct pricing that local suppliers can't match.\n\nCome back when you're ready to go bigger, we'd love to help! 🕯️"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":232,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14534,"totalTokens":14769,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.0058000000000000005,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.0908375,"total":0.0966525}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770915509313}}
