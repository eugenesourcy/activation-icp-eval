Great to hear you're looking into sourcing jewelry and accessories — smart category to start with since the entry cost is one of the lowest in sourcing.\n\nHere's how it works in a nutshell:\n\n*How the process goes:*\n\n1. You share what you want (photo, style, material)\n2. We find matching suppliers from our factory network\n3. You get quotes with pricing, MOQ, and photos\n4. You approve a sample first ($5-30 per piece depending on complexity)\n5. Once you're happy, bulk production starts (15-25 days)\n6. Shipping to your country (sea: 20-35 days, air: 5-10 days)\n\n*Realistic investment for jewelry & accessories:*\n\n- *Ready-made designs (no customization):* MOQ as low as 50-200 pcs. Think $0.30-$3/piece for things like earrings, bracelets, necklaces. So you could start with as little as *$100-$300* for product cost.\n- *Custom logo/packaging:* MOQ usually 200-500 pcs. Budget around *$300-$800* total.\n- *Fully custom design (new mold):* MOQ 500-1000+. Mold fee $50-$200 + product cost. Budget *$800-$2,000+*.\n\nOn top of product cost, factor in *shipping* ($50-$150 for small orders via air) and possible *import duties* depending on your country.\n\nAs a teenager starting out, the ready-made route at $150-$400 total is very doable and low risk.\n\nQuick question — what kind of jewelry are you thinking? Things like stainless steel rings, beaded bracelets, gold-plated necklaces? And where would we be shipping to?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":464,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14250,"totalTokens":14717,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.011600000000000001,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.0890625,"total":0.1006775}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770915436792}}

Smart pick.\n\nFor that style, here's what you're typically looking at:\n\n*Realistic pricing (stainless steel, gold PVD plated, tarnish-free):*\n\n- *Rings:* $0.80 - $3/pc\n- *Earrings:* $0.50 - $2.50/pc\n- *Pendants/necklaces:* $1 - $4/pc\n- *Bracelets:* $1 - $3.50/pc\n- *Watches:* $5 - $25/pc (depends on movement type)\n\nThe gold finish you want is called *PVD or 18K gold plating on 316L stainless steel* — that's the industry standard for tarnish-free. Make sure to ask for that specifically so you don't end up with cheap plating that fades.\n\n*The process with us:*\n\n1. You share reference photos or links of styles you like\n2. We match you with verified suppliers who specialize in minimalist stainless steel jewelry\n3. You receive quotes + product photos within 24-48 hours\n4. You order samples to check quality in hand\n5. Approve → bulk order → QC inspection → ships to you\n\nWe also have a *$100 sample voucher* you can use to test quality before committing to bulk — so you're not risking much upfront.\n\nTo get started, I just need to know — what country are you based in so I can factor in shipping?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":391,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14805,"totalTokens":15199,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.009775,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.09253125000000001,"total":0.10232125}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770915547719}}

Femmora has a clean, premium ring to it.\n\nSince you're still in research mode, here's what I'd suggest as your game plan:\n\n*Start small and smart:*\n\nPick 5-10 bestselling styles (think simple gold hoops, a dainty chain necklace, a couple of stacking rings) rather than trying to stock everything at once. This keeps your first order low-risk and lets you test what your audience actually buys.\n\nA realistic first order could look like:\n- 10 styles × 20-50 pcs each\n- Product cost: *$300-$800*\n- Samples first: *$30-$80* (covered mostly by our $100 voucher)\n- Shipping: *$50-$150* (air for small first order)\n- *Total to launch: roughly $400-$1,000*\n\nThat's very doable for a first run, and you'd have enough inventory to start selling and reinvest profits into bigger orders.\n\nHere's what would help me find the right suppliers for you — could you send me a few reference photos of the *exact style* you're going for? Screenshot from Pinterest, Instagram, anywhere. That way I match you with factories that specialize in that specific aesthetic rather than generic jewelry suppliers."}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":314,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":15262,"totalTokens":15579,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.007850000000000001,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.0953875,"total":0.1032525}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770915581195}}
