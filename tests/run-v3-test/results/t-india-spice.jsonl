Here's how it works:\n\n*Step 1:* We find factories that make your jar style (round, square, hex — most common for spices are 100-250ml round jars with metal lids). Pricing typically runs *$0.30-0.80/unit* depending on size and lid type.\n\n*Step 2:* Custom labels are printed separately or applied at the factory. At 2,000 units, most factories can do this — MOQ for custom label work is usually 1,000+.\n\n*Step 3:* You approve a sample, we do QC, then ship. Sea freight to India is about *20-25 days*, production *15-20 days*. Total roughly 5-7 weeks.\n\nWhat size jars are you thinking — do you have a reference photo or something similar you've seen? (This helps us match you with the right factory fast)"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":272,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14311,"totalTokens":14586,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.0068000000000000005,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.08944375,"total":0.09625875}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770916898954}}
