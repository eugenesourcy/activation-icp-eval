Often the \"cheaper\" Alibaba listing is a trading company or the quality isn't the same, but we're always transparent about pricing.\n\nNow let me do the math on your budget: 200,000 naira is roughly *$125 USD*. For bags and accessories, typical unit costs range $3-15 depending on type and material.\n\nThat's around 8-40 units — which is really sample territory, not bulk sourcing. At that level, international shipping costs alone would eat most of your budget.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest: start with local suppliers in Lagos (Aba market is great for bags) to test your brand and build sales. When you're ready to scale to *500+ units* with a budget of $1,500+, that's where international sourcing makes real sense — and we'd love to help then.\n\nWant me to give you a rough idea of what pricing looks like at bulk quantities so you can plan ahead?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":242,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14606,"totalTokens":14851,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.006050000000000001,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.09128750000000001,"total":0.09735250000000001}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770916925734}}
