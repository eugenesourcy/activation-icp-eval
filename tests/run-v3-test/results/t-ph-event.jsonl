With production at 15 days, we're looking at ~25 days total, so we'd need to lock in the order ASAP to hit March 15.\n\nAir freight (5-7 days) is also an option if we need a buffer — adds maybe $0.10-0.20/unit for tote bags, very reasonable.\n\nFor a product launch, I'd recommend *cotton canvas* — it feels premium, holds print well, and people actually reuse them (more brand exposure). At 2,000 units you'd be around *$2.50-3.50/unit* for a nice 12oz canvas with a quality screen print.\n\nDo you have a design ready, or just a logo?
