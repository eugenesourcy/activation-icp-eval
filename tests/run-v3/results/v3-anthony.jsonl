Let me do some quick math here.\n\nRM 5-10 profit per unit on 50 units = RM 250-500 total. At 50 units, the shipping cost from China would likely eat most of that margin — international freight for small quantities adds RM 5-15+ per unit alone.\n\nFor quantities under 100, you'd get better pricing from local Malaysian suppliers or platforms like *Shopee Wholesale* or *1688* (with a shipping agent). The landed cost will be much lower.\n\nWhen you're ready to scale to *200+ units*, international sourcing starts making real sense — that's where we can get you factory-direct pricing that beats local wholesale.
