I need to be upfront about something important though.\n\nUnfortunately, *batteries are a category we can't reliably source* through international shipping. Lead-acid batteries (like the Long 12V/7Ah) fall under IATA dangerous goods regulations — they require special packaging, certified carriers, and hazardous materials documentation. This makes international sourcing risky with frequent customs holds and damage issues.\n\nFor batteries specifically, *local suppliers or authorized distributors* in your country will give you better pricing, faster delivery, and proper warranty coverage.\n\nThat said — the *fuses and connectors* are absolutely something we can help with! Those are straightforward electrical components we source regularly.\n\nCould you share a photo or reference link for the specific fuse and connector types you need?
