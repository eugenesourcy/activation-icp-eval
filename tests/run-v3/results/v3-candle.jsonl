Shipping costs alone would be more than the products themselves.\n\nFor small starter kits like this, you'll get *much better prices* from:\n- *Amazon* or *Daraz* (if you're in Pakistan/SEA)\n- *Shopee/Tokopedia* (if in Indonesia/Malaysia)\n- Local craft supply stores near you\n\nWhen you scale up to 500+ wicks, 50+ jars, or buying wax by the ton — that's where we save you serious money.
