Great choice — jewelry and accessories are one of the easiest categories to start with from China. Here's a quick breakdown:\n\n*How it works:*\n• You tell us what you want (earrings, necklaces, bracelets, etc.) — a photo or link helps a lot\n• We find factory suppliers, get you quotes with pricing\n• You approve a sample first ($5-15/piece), then place bulk\n• Production takes 15-25 days, shipping 20-35 days by sea or 5-10 by air\n\n*Investment range for jewelry/accessories:*\n• Ready-stock (no customization): as low as *$200-500* for 100-300 pieces\n• Custom logo/packaging: around *$500-1,500* for 200-500 pieces\n• Unit prices are usually *$0.50-5/piece* depending on material (alloy, stainless steel, sterling silver)\n\nSo realistically, you could start with *$300-500 USD* if you go with trendy alloy pieces and ready designs.\n\nWhat type of jewelry are you thinking — earrings, necklaces, rings, mixed?

You share references — photos, Pinterest links, or styles you like\n2. We match you with verified factories and get quotes\n3. You pick what you want and we send *samples first* so you can check quality\n4. Once approved, bulk production starts (15-25 days)\n5. QC inspection before shipping → delivered to your door\n\nWe also have a *$100 sample voucher* you can use to test quality before committing to bulk.\n\nRoughly how many pieces are you thinking for your first order?
