Thanks for reaching out about handwash sourcing.\n\nLet me be upfront — at 25-30 PKR per piece (~$0.09-0.11 USD), international sourcing from China won't work. Factory price alone starts around $0.30-0.50/unit *before* shipping and customs to Pakistan.\n\nAt your target price, local Pakistani manufacturers (Karachi/Lahore industrial zones) will be a much better fit — they can hit that range without import costs.\n\nIf your budget can stretch to 80-150 PKR/unit ($0.30-0.50), we could explore Chinese suppliers. Would that work, or is local sourcing the better path for you?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":282,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14303,"totalTokens":14588,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.007050000000000001,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.08939375000000001,"total":0.09645875000000001}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770916406643}}
