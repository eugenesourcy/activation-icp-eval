# v4 Test Set Persona Profiles (Revised)

Revised based on Reddit research (r/FulfillmentByAmazon, r/importexport, r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness). Real sourcing buyers are skeptical, compare alternatives, worry about scams, and are NOT committed to Sourcy by default.

## T1. Ghost

**Scenario:** Most common pattern from test period (22 out of 29 leads). Says hi, maybe one vague word, then disappears.

**What they do:** Send "Hi." If bot responds, they send one more vague message ("bags" or "shoes"). Then silence. Max 2 messages.

**Why they're here:** Unknown — ad click, browsing, accidental, or genuinely interested but distracted/low commitment.

**Communication style:** Single words. No elaboration.

**Intent level:** Unknown/very low.

**What the bot should do:** Simple open question, don't over-invest. Can't fix a ghost.

## T2. Alibaba Veteran ("Why should I pay your markup?")

**Source:** Real pattern from Reddit — "I've used Alibaba for years... my sourcing agent got HIGHER prices than Alibaba"

**Who:** FBA seller or established e-commerce operator. Has been sourcing on Alibaba for 2+ years. Already has supplier relationships. Found Sourcy from an ad or referral and is skeptical.

**What they want:** They're testing whether Sourcy can beat their current Alibaba prices. They'll name a specific product they already source and ask for pricing. If Sourcy can't beat or match, they'll leave.

**What they know:** Their current unit cost (they'll share it). MOQs. Shipping logistics. They know more than most leads about sourcing.

**What they don't know:** Whether Sourcy has access to factories their Alibaba searches don't reach.

**Communication style:** Direct, business-like, no small talk. Expects numbers fast. Will challenge vague claims ("our prices are better" → "prove it, my current cost is $X").

**Dropoff triggers:** Vague value props without specific numbers. Being asked basic questions they consider beneath them (what's your MOQ? what material?). Slow response. Feeling like the bot knows less than they do.

**Intent level:** LOW for Sourcy specifically. High for sourcing in general — they're already buying. They'll only switch if there's a concrete, provable benefit.

**Critical constraint:** They will share their current price as a benchmark. If the bot can't credibly address whether Sourcy can beat it (even with a "we'd need to check with our factories"), they're gone. They will NOT provide personal info or go through an SR process unless they see a pricing advantage first.

## T3. Burned Buyer ("I got scammed by a sourcing agent before")

**Source:** Real pattern from Reddit — "Zignify scammed us out of $7,000" / "agent did no QC, received mold" / "agents running off with money"

**Who:** Small brand owner who used a sourcing agent previously and had a bad experience. Now they're wary of all sourcing platforms. Considering going back to doing everything themselves on Alibaba.

**What they want:** Custom printed packaging for their cosmetics brand, ~1000 units. They NEED sourcing help (tried DIY, too time-consuming) but don't trust anyone.

**What they know:** What they need. What went wrong last time (agent didn't do QC, products arrived defective, lost money). How Alibaba works.

**What they don't know:** Whether Sourcy is different from the agent who burned them.

**Communication style:** Cautious. Asks a lot of questions about process, guarantees, and what happens if something goes wrong. Tests for transparency. Will mention their bad experience early.

**Dropoff triggers:** Any hint of opacity about pricing (hidden markups). Being asked to pay upfront before seeing anything. Not being able to talk to a human. Generic reassurances ("we do QC") without specifics on how.

**Intent level:** MEDIUM for sourcing. LOW for trusting Sourcy immediately. Needs trust built over the conversation. Even if the bot handles everything well, she may still say "let me think about it" — that's realistic, not a failure.

**Critical constraint:** She will explicitly say "I've been scammed before." The bot MUST address this directly — not brush past it. If the bot gives a generic "we're different" without explaining HOW (QC process, payment protection, sample before bulk), she's gone. She may end the conversation with "I'll think about it" even if the bot does everything right — that's a realistic medium-intent outcome.

## T4. Price Shopper (messaging 3 platforms simultaneously)

**Source:** Common pattern — leads who message multiple sourcing platforms and go with whoever responds fastest and cheapest.

**Who:** Someone launching a small clothing brand. Has messaged Sourcy, a sourcing agent on Instagram, and is also browsing 1688 themselves. Whichever platform gives the best price + fastest response wins.

**What they want:** 500 custom printed t-shirts (their design, multiple sizes).

**What they know:** Approximate pricing from 1688 browsing ($2-4/unit). They'll use this as a benchmark.

**What they don't know:** Shipping costs to their country. QC process. Whether 1688 prices are realistic after adding middleman/shipping/customs.

**Communication style:** Rapid-fire. Short messages. Gives minimal info — just enough to get a quote. Won't elaborate unless the quote looks promising. Impatient — if response takes more than 2 turns to get to pricing, they'll engage with whoever else replied faster.

**Dropoff triggers:** Slow response (they're comparing response times). Being asked too many questions before getting a number. Not getting a price range within the first 2 messages. Being asked for personal info before seeing pricing.

**Intent level:** HIGH for buying. NEUTRAL for Sourcy vs alternatives. Pure price + speed comparison.

**Critical constraint:** They will share a benchmark price ("I've seen $3/unit on 1688"). If the bot can't address this competitively within 2 turns, they go silent — not because they're upset, just because someone else was faster. They will NOT go through a full SR unless the price is competitive. Silence after 2 turns = they went with someone else.

## T5. Researcher (not buying this month)

**Source:** Common pattern — people doing market research before committing to a product idea.

**Who:** Someone considering starting a candle brand (different from the student — this person has budget but hasn't committed to the idea yet). Messaging Sourcy to understand costs and feasibility before deciding whether to pursue the business.

**What they want:** To understand: how much does it cost to start a candle brand sourcing from China? What MOQs? What margins can I expect? They're gathering data, not placing an order.

**What they know:** They've watched YouTube videos about starting a candle brand. They have ~$5,000 to invest if the numbers work. But they haven't decided yet.

**What they don't know:** Real sourcing costs, process, timelines. Whether $5,000 is enough.

**Communication style:** Asks process questions. "What if" scenarios. Not in a hurry. Will ask follow-up questions about details. Not ready to give contact info.

**Dropoff triggers:** Being pushed to commit or give personal info before they're ready. Feeling like they're being "sold to" instead of educated. High-pressure sales tactics. Being told "send me your email and we'll get quotes" before they've decided whether to pursue the business at all.

**Intent level:** LOW for immediate purchase. MEDIUM for future purchase. They're deciding whether to start the business — Sourcy can't push them past that decision, only give them the information to make it.

**Critical constraint:** This person will NOT give their name, email, or commit to an order in this conversation. The best outcome is: they leave educated about costs and process, and come back in 2-4 weeks when they've decided. If the bot pushes for an SR, they'll disengage. If the bot educates them well, they'll say "thank you, this is really helpful, I'll be back when I'm ready." That IS a success, even though there's no SR.

## T6. Ad-Click Confused ("What is Sourcy?")

**Source:** Sourcy runs ads. Some people click through without understanding what the platform does.

**Who:** Someone who clicked a Sourcy ad on Instagram or Google, ended up on WhatsApp, but doesn't actually understand what sourcing means or what Sourcy does. They think it might be a shop where they can buy products.

**What they want:** Unclear to themselves. Maybe they saw "get products from China" and thought they could buy a few items directly.

**What they know:** Almost nothing about B2B sourcing. They may think Sourcy is like AliExpress — browse and buy.

**What they don't know:** What sourcing means. What MOQ means. That this is B2B, not retail.

**Communication style:** Confused. Asks basic questions ("do you sell products?" "can I buy just one?"). May mix up sourcing with retail shopping.

**Dropoff triggers:** Jargon (MOQ, FOB, DDP). Being talked to like they should already know how sourcing works. Realizing this isn't what they expected and feeling embarrassed.

**Intent level:** VERY LOW for Sourcy's actual service. They're not a sourcing buyer — they're a consumer who clicked the wrong ad.

**Critical constraint:** This person will ask "do you sell products?" or "can I order just 2-3 pieces?" They need a simple, non-judgmental explanation of what Sourcy does and a redirect to retail platforms (AliExpress, Amazon) if they want consumer quantities. Exit should be kind, not condescending. They should leave understanding what Sourcy is — they might come back later when they actually need sourcing.
