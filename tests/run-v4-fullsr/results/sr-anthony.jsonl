Let me do the math with you though:\n\n50 units is a small batch, and once you factor in shipping from China to Malaysia, the per-unit cost gets tough. For TWS earbuds at ~RM20-40/unit landed, a RM5-10 margin works — but international shipping on 50 units eats most of that.\n\nFor that quantity, you'd get better pricing on Shopee, Lazada, or even 1688 with a local forwarder — no MOQ headaches and faster delivery.\n\nWhen you're ready to scale to 200+ units, that's where we really shine — factory-direct pricing drops 30-40% and shipping per unit makes sense.
