Since you're just starting out with small quantities like that, international sourcing from China won't make sense for you — the shipping cost alone would be more than the products themselves.\n\nFor these quantities, you'd get *much better prices* from:\n\n- *Local craft suppliers* in your area\n- *Amazon or Etsy* for starter kits\n- *AliExpress or 1688* where you can buy small quantities directly\n\nWhen you scale up to *100+ jars, 500+ wicks, bulk wax by the carton* — that's where we really shine and save you serious money.
