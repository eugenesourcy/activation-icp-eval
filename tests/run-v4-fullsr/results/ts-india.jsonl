Typical price: *$0.30-0.80/unit* depending on size and lid type.\n\n*Step 2:* Custom labels are printed separately or applied at the factory.

Great taste on the minimalist look.\n\nLet me do a quick budget check: ₹1.5 lakh ≈ *~$1,800 USD*. For 2,000 units, that's about *$0.90/unit* including jar + lid + custom label + shipping to Mumbai. That's tight but doable — jars alone run $0.30-0.50, labels $0.05-0.15, and sea freight to Mumbai adds roughly $0.15-0.25/unit.\n\nHere's what the process looks like for you:\n\n- *Sampling first* — factory sends 5-10 sample jars (2-3 weeks). We have a *$100 sample voucher* you can use for this.\n- *Production* — 15-20 days once you approve\n- *Shipping* — sea freight to Mumbai, ~20-25 days\n- *Total timeline:* roughly 8-10 weeks end to end\n\nTo get you quotes, what's your target launch date?
