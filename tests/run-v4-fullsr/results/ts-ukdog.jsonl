Custom dog harnesses are a solid category — here's what I can tell you right away:\n\nFor 500 units with custom logo, you're looking at roughly *$3-8/unit* depending on material (nylon webbing is cheapest, padded mesh or neoprene runs higher). At that quantity, most factories can do custom logo printing or embossing no problem.\n\nLet me pull up that reference so I can give you more specific pricing 👇\n\nCould you share a photo or screenshot of the harness style you like?

Padded mesh with embroidery is a popular combo right now.\n\nQuick reality check on budget: *£3-4 GBP (~$3.80-5 USD)* per unit for padded mesh with embroidery across 3 sizes is tight but doable at 500 units. Embroidery adds ~$0.30-0.50/unit vs printing. If budget gets squeezed, heat transfer logo is a cheaper alternative that still looks clean.\n\nFor timeline — if we get this moving soon, production ~20-25 days + sea freight to Manchester ~25-30 days puts you right at May. Air freight (5-7 days) is a backup if production runs long, just adds ~$1-2/unit.\n\nOne question: do you need custom packaging (branded boxes, hang tags) or is polybag fine? *(this affects unit cost — branded packaging can add $0.30-1/unit)*"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":222,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14563,"totalTokens":14788,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.00555,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.09101875000000001,"total":0.09658375000000001}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770919096619}}
