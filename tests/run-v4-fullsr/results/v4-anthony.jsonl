Let me do the math with you though:\n\n50 units at ~$3-8/unit = $150-400 product cost. Then shipping to Malaysia adds $2-5/unit for small quantities. At RM5-10 profit per unit, you're looking at RM250-500 total profit — but shipping costs could eat most of that.\n\nFor 50 units, you'd honestly get better pricing on Shopee or 1688 directly — no international shipping headaches and faster turnaround.\n\nWhen you're ready to scale to 200+ units with your own branding, that's where we really shine — better factory pricing and custom logo options. Hit us up when you get there! 🎧"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":168,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14444,"totalTokens":14615,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.004200000000000001,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.09027500000000001,"total":0.09449}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770921552335}}
