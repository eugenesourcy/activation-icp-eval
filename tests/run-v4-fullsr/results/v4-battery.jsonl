Thanks for reaching out 🙏\n\nI need to be upfront — we *can't source batteries* internationally. Lead-acid batteries like the Long 12V/7Ah have strict IATA and shipping regulations (classified as dangerous goods), which makes them unreliable and risky to ship from overseas factories.\n\nFor batteries, your best bet is a *local distributor* in your country — they'll have fresher stock, proper warranties, and no shipping restrictions.\n\nFor the *fuses and connectors* though — those we can definitely help with! Could you send a photo or reference link so I can match the exact type?
