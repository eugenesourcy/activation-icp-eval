For these quantities (25-35 wicks, 10-15 jars, small fragrance bottles), international sourcing from China wouldn't make sense — the *shipping alone* would cost more than the products themselves.\n\nFor a beginner candle-making kit at this scale, you'd get *much better pricing* buying locally or from platforms like Amazon, Etsy, or even AliExpress (which handles small qty shipping).\n\nWhen your candle business grows and you're ready for larger orders (100+ jars, bulk wax by the kg, etc.), we'd love to help you source directly from factories — that's where the real savings kick in.
