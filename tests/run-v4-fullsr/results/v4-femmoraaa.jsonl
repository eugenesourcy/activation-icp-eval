Great that you're looking into sourcing jewelry and accessories — it's one of the most popular categories for new businesses, and the margins can be solid.\n\nHere's how it works with Sourcy:\n\n*1. You tell us what you want* — send a photo, link, or description of the jewelry/accessories you're after (earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc.)\n\n*2. We find suppliers* — we match you with verified factories in China and get you quotes within 24-48 hours.\n\n*3. You sample first* — before any bulk order, you get samples to check quality. We even have a *$100 sample voucher* to help with that.\n\n*4. You approve & we ship* — once you're happy, production takes 15-25 days + shipping 20-35 days by sea (or 5-10 days by air).\n\nNow for *investment* — good news, jewelry is one of the most affordable categories to start:\n\n- *Ready-stock jewelry* (no customization): as low as $0.30-$2/piece, MOQ around 50-200 pieces. So you could start with *$100-$300*.\n- *Custom logo/packaging*: $0.50-$3/piece, MOQ 200-500 pieces. Budget around *$300-$800*.\n- *Fully custom designs*: $1-5/piece, MOQ 500-1000+. Budget *$500-$2,000+*.\n\nDon't forget to factor in *shipping* (~$50-$150 for small orders by air) and possible *customs duties* depending on your country.\n\nWhat type of jewelry/accessories are you thinking — and roughly how many pieces for your first order?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":436,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14326,"totalTokens":14765,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.0109,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.0895375,"total":0.1004525}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770921372254}}
