With DDP (door-to-door), the supplier bears risk until delivery. We also recommend transit insurance (~2-3% of order value) which covers damage claims fully.\n\n*QC photos* — yes, our team does on-site inspection before shipment and sends you a full photo report (product close-ups, packaging, drop test results for boxes). I don't have past reports to share in chat, but you'll get yours before anything ships.\n\nNow — rigid magnetic closure boxes for lipstick with full CMYK print, that's a premium tier. You're looking at roughly *$1.20–$2.50/unit* at 1,000 units depending on finish (matte lamination, spot UV, foil stamping). What finish style are you going for?
