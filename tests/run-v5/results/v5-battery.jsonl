However, I need to be upfront about something important:\n\n*Batteries are a restricted category for us.* Lead-acid batteries like the Long 12V/7Ah fall under IATA dangerous goods classification — they require special packaging, hazardous materials documentation, and carry a real risk of customs seizure during international shipping.\n\nEven if importing batteries is straightforward in your country, the challenge is getting them there safely through international carriers. We'd rather not risk your money on a shipment that could get held up or rejected.\n\n*What we CAN help with:*\nThe fuses and connectors — those are absolutely something we can source. Could you share a bit more detail?\n\n- *Fuses (x8):* What amp rating and type? (blade fuse, glass tube, cartridge?)\n- *Connectors (x64):* What kind?

The restriction isn't about your country's import rules.\n\nThe problem is on the *shipping side:* international carriers (DHL, FedEx, sea freight lines) classify lead-acid batteries as dangerous goods. That means special packaging, hazmat documentation, higher shipping costs, and a real chance the shipment gets held at origin or in transit. It's not worth risking your money on that.\n\nFor the Long 12V/7Ah, you'll get a better deal sourcing locally in Pakistan — faster delivery, no shipping risk, and local warranty.\n\n*But let's get moving on the fuses and connectors!* Those we can definitely source at good prices.
