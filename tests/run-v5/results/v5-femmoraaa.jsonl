Great that you're looking into sourcing jewelry and accessories — it's actually one of the best categories for starting out because the per-unit costs are low.\n\nHere's how it works, step by step:\n\n*1. You pick what you want*\nSend me a photo, link, or description — earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, hair clips, etc. The more specific, the better pricing I can find.\n\n*2. We find suppliers*\nWe match you with verified factories in China. You'll get quotes with pricing, MOQs, and photos.\n\n*3. You sample first*\nBefore any bulk order, you test samples ($2-15 per piece depending on item). We also have a *$100 sample voucher* for qualified leads.\n\n*4. Bulk order + shipping*\nProduction takes 15-25 days, shipping 20-35 days by sea (or 5-10 days by air for small/light orders like jewelry).\n\nNow for the investment side — jewelry is teenager-friendly:\n\n- *Fashion jewelry* (alloy, acrylic, beads): $0.20–$1.50/unit\n- *Stainless steel pieces*: $1–$4/unit\n- *MOQ:* Ready stock 50-200 pcs, custom logo 200-500 pcs\n- *Realistic starter budget:* $300–$800 USD gets you 200-500 mixed pieces + shipping\n\nSo with around $500 you could genuinely start a small collection to resell.\n\nWhat type of jewelry or accessories are you most interested in?

And at those prices, if you retail at $15–$30 per piece, your margins are 5-10x — which is excellent.\n\n*What I'd recommend for Femmoraa:*\nGo with *PVD gold stainless steel, minimal aesthetic* — think clean lines, no big stones, dainty chains. That matches your brand name perfectly and those pieces move fast on Instagram.\n\nTo get this started, I just need a few things:\n\n- *Where are you based?* (for shipping cost + timeline)\n- *Can you share 3-5 reference photos* of the style you like? Pinterest, Instagram posts, anything — so I match the exact vibe you want\n\nOnce I have that, I'll pull factory options with real quotes for you within 24-48 hours 🙂"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":389,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":15630,"totalTokens":16022,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.009725000000000001,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.09768750000000001,"total":0.10742750000000001}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770922137191}}
