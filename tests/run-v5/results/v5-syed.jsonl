Thanks for reaching out 👋\n\nSo for liquid handwash — let me be upfront with you on the numbers.\n\n25-30 PKR per piece is roughly *$0.09-0.11 USD*. Factory price for liquid handwash (even basic 200-500ml bottles) starts around *$0.30-0.80 USD* per unit depending on size and formulation — that's before shipping to Pakistan.\n\nAt your budget, the unit cost is about 3-7x below what factories charge, so the math unfortunately doesn't work for international sourcing.\n\n*A couple of options though:*\n\n- If your budget can reach *$0.50-0.80/unit* (around 140-220 PKR), we could source 500ml handwash bottles with custom branding at MOQs of 3,000-5,000 units\n- For that price range in PKR, a *local Pakistani manufacturer* would likely be your best bet — they skip international shipping costs entirely\n\nWould either of those directions work for you?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3,"output":308,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":14627,"totalTokens":14938,"cost":{"input":0.000015000000000000002,"output":0.0077,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.09141875000000001,"total":0.09913375}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770922053709}}
