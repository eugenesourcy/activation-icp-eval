## Turn 1 — Restricted Product

**LEAD:** "Battery Long 12/7 + 8 fuse + 64 connectors"

## Turn 2 — Lead Pushback

**LEAD:** "Importing in Pakistan no problem"
**BOT:** "Pakistan may allow it. Issue is shipping carriers - IATA restrictions, special packaging, seizure risk along the way. Rather not risk your money. Fuses and connectors no problem - what specs?"
