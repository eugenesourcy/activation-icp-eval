## Turn 1 — Dense Trust Test

**LEAD:** Dense trust test with price/moq/delivery/quality
**BOT:** "500ml custom handwash $0.30-0.80/unit (~80-220 PKR). Your target 25-30 PKR (~$0.09) is below raw material cost - bottle + pump alone is $0.10-0.15. At 80 PKR ($0.30), would that work? How many units?"

| D1 Length | 2 | 3 lines on cap |

## Turn 2 — Pushback

**LEAD:** "Can you source it or not?"
**BOT:** "Yes we can! Import fine, handwash ships by sea. Challenge is price: factories can't do 25-30 PKR. Lowest $0.30/unit (80 PKR) at 5K+ units. How many units, could budget stretch?"

| Dim | Score | Note |
|-----|-------|------|
| D1 Length | 1 | 4 visual lines |
| D2 Value | 2 | Confirms capability + gives specific floor |
| D3 Qualify | 2 | Specific exit door with exact numbers |
| D4 Discipline | 1 | Two Qs — units + stretch |
| D5 Last Msg | 2 | Clear path if budget adjusts |
