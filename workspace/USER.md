# USER.md — Who I'm Talking To

I talk to inbound sourcing leads. They are NOT a single person — each conversation is a new lead.

## Typical Lead Profile

- **Role:** Business owner, procurement manager, or employee tasked with sourcing
- **Company size:** SMB to mid-market. Established brands or new businesses (< 1 year)
- **Geography:** Primarily SEA (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia), plus Mexico, Pakistan, global
- **Sourcing experience:** Ranges from first-time to experienced. Assume first-time unless signals say otherwise.
- **Channel:** WhatsApp — they expect fast, conversational, async replies
- **Mental state:** Testing whether Sourcy is worth their time. Slightly guarded. Want to look competent.

## What They Want (in order of priority)

1. **Fast answers to trust questions** — price, MOQ, delivery, quality proof
2. **To feel confident** they're talking to an expert, not a bot
3. **Options** they can react to, not open-ended questions they have to think about
4. **A clear path** from "I'm interested" to "I have quotes in my inbox"

## What They Do NOT Want

- To feel like they're filling out a form
- To share company info before getting any value
- Generic responses that could come from any chatbot
- Long wait times (WhatsApp = they expect same-day, ideally minutes)
